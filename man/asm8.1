.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Ar assembly_file
.Pp
Assemble the given assembly_file, output the result to
.Qq a.out
.Sh DESCRITION
Assemble CHIP-8 programs.
.Sh ASM8 INSTRUCTION SET
.Bl -tag
.It ADD Vx, imm
Add the value stored in Vx to the given immediate value and store the result in
Vx
.It ADD I, Vy
Add the value stored in I to the value stored in Vy and store the result in I.
If there is an overflow, set VF to 1.
.It ADD Vx, Vy
Add the value stored in Vx to the value stored in Vy and store the result in
Vx. If there is an overflow, set VF to 1.
.It AND Vx, Vy
Perform a bitwise-AND of the values stored in Vx and Vy, store the result in Vx
.It CALL label
Store the program counter (PC) on the stack and jump to the address represented
by the given label
.It CLS 
Clear the screen (set every pixel to 0/black)
.It DRW Vx, Vy, width
Draw a sprite on screen at a screen location whose x coordinate is stored in Vx
and whose y coordinate is stored in Vy, specifying the sprite width in bytes.
The sprite is loaded from the memory location currently stored in the I
register. If any pixel that was previously on/white - i.e. set to 1 - is turned
off/black - i.e. set to 0 - then set the VF register to one, otherwise set it
to zero. This means that VF can be used to detect collisions.
.It JP addr
Set the program counter to the given address - i.e. jump to given address
.It LD Vx, Vy
Copy the value stored in Vy into Vx
.It LD Vx, K
Wait for a key press and store the value of the key pressed in Vx
.It OR Vx, Vy
Perform a bitwise-OR of the values in Vx and Vy, store the result in Vx
.It RET
Return from a function
.It SE Vx, imm
Skip the next instruction if the value stored in Vx is equal to the given
immediate value
.It SE Vx, Vy
Skip the next instruction is the value stored in Vx is equal to the value
stored in Vy
.It SKNP Vx
Skip the next instruction if the key represented by the value stored in Vx
is not pressed
.It SKP Vx
Skip the next instruction if the key represented by the value stored inVx is
pressed
.It SNE Vx, imm
Skip the next instruction if the value stored in Vx is not equal to the given
immediate value
.It SNE Vx, Vy 
Skip the next instruction if the value stored in Vx is not equal to the value
stored in Vy 
.It SUB Vx, Vy
Subtract the value stored in Vy from the value stored in Vx, store the result
in Vx. If there is an underflow, set VF to 1.
.It SUB Vx, Vy
Subtract the value stored in Vx from the value stored in Vy, store the result
in Vx. If there is an underflow, set VF to 1.
